# ds_module_4_pandas
In this challenge, we will analyze test scores with school districts in order to help with school budgeting priorities. We will be using jupyter pandas to assist us in finding key metrics such as percentage of the students passing in math and reading and what the budget is per student. We used data frames and binning as our main skills used within this assignment.
